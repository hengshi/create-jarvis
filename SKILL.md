name: create-jarvis-skill
description: Help any agent bootstrap and adapt an enterprise JARVIS methodology by clarifying business intent, inventorying company digital assets, repos, and workflows, mapping missing source skills, repo skills, and workflow skills, generating first-pass scaffolds and templates, forcing company-specific adaptation, and turning the work into a multi-owner rollout plan. Use when building, redesigning, or scaling a company-specific JARVIS rather than just generating a one-shot knowledge repo.

# Create JARVIS Skill

Build a company-specific JARVIS as an agent operating system, not as a document dump.

**This `SKILL.md` is the golden path.**
Use `references/en/` only to support a specific step here. Use `templates/en/` only to produce the artifacts required by a step here.
Chinese materials under `references/zh/` and `templates/zh/` are human-facing mirrors and helpers; they do not replace this main route.

## What success looks like

A successful first pass does **not** mean "the whole company is mapped".
It means:
- one real business loop is chosen,
- the sources, repos, and workflows for that loop are mapped,
- a company-specific JARVIS skeleton exists,
- the right source / repo / workflow skill stubs exist,
- humans have confirmed the truth-bearing fields,
- and the result is ready for a real pilot.

## The Golden Path

Do the phases in order.
Do not skip the stop conditions.
Do not present scaffolding as mature knowledge.

## Phase 1 — CLARIFY

### Goal
Define why this company needs JARVIS and which first closed loop is worth proving.

### Output
Create:
- `templates/en/jarvis-build-brief.md`

The build brief must state:
- business intent
- target users
- first valuable loop
- success signal
- current rollout scope

### Must confirm with humans
- why JARVIS is being built now
- which first workflow to prove
- what success looks like
- what is explicitly out of scope for now

### Stop if
- the first valuable loop is still vague
- success is described as “better knowledge” with no concrete operating scenario
- the scope is drifting toward “map the whole company” before a pilot exists

### Read only if needed
- `references/en/positioning.md`
- `references/en/adoption-guide.md`
- `references/en/example-pilot-shape.md`

---

## Phase 2 — INVENTORY

### Goal
Map only the real operating surface needed for the first loop.

### Output
Create:
- `templates/en/source-inventory.md`
- `templates/en/repo-inventory.md`
- `templates/en/workflow-inventory.md`

Capture only the sources, repos, and workflows required for the pilot.

### Must confirm with humans
- source names and owners
- repo roles and maintainers
- source-of-truth locations
- workflow boundaries and handoffs
- access constraints that affect execution

### Stop if
- owners are guessed
- repo roles are inferred but unconfirmed
- workflow boundaries are still generic software lore rather than company reality

### Read only if needed
- `references/en/company-adaptation.md`
- `references/en/repo-skills.md`
- `references/en/source-skills.md`
- `references/en/workflow-skills.md`

---

## Phase 3 — CLASSIFY

### Goal
Separate what may be scaffolded now from what requires human confirmation and what must grow later through real use.

### Output
Classify intended artifacts into three buckets:
1. safe to scaffold automatically
2. requires human confirmation
3. must emerge through real START → WORK → END writeback

Use this to decide what the generator is allowed to produce in the next phases.

### Must confirm with humans
- any truth-bearing field that the agent is about to freeze into documents
- any ownership assignment
- any workflow or routing rule that affects real operations

### Stop if
- you are about to generate fake historical content
- you are about to treat placeholders as settled truth
- you are about to create detailed known issues / decisions / rejected features from speculation

### Read
- `references/en/instance-generation-contract.md`
- `references/en/instance-readiness.md`

---

## Phase 4 — SCAFFOLD

### Goal
Generate the minimum company-specific JARVIS structure needed to support the pilot.

### Output
Generate the core skeleton as needed for the pilot:
- root README
- MAINTENANCE guide
- module skeletons
- source routing skeletons
- cross-cutting skeletons
- tools index skeleton
- optional raw/export boundary notes
- company JARVIS entry skill stub

Typical templates:
- `templates/en/root-readme.md`
- `templates/en/maintenance.md`
- `templates/en/module-overview.md`
- `templates/en/source-readme.md`
- `templates/en/module-interactions.md`
- `templates/en/version-changelog.md`
- `templates/en/tools-readme.md`
- `templates/en/raw-exports-readme.md`
- `templates/en/company-jarvis-skill-stub.md`
- `templates/en/instance-skeleton.md`

### Must confirm with humans
- whether the proposed topology matches the company’s real shape
- whether `_raw/` / `_exports/` is actually needed
- whether a proposed module split matches the company’s mental model

### Stop if
- the skeleton is turning into a content dump
- the scaffold is pretending to contain real historical memory
- module boundaries are being invented without confirmation

### Read only if needed
- `references/en/concrete-instance-topology.md`
- `references/en/detailed-maintenance-contracts.md`
- `references/en/write-contracts.md`

---

## Phase 5 — BOOTSTRAP SKILLS

### Goal
Generate the smallest skill set that lets agents operate inside the pilot loop.

### Output
Generate only the high-leverage stubs needed now:
- source skill stubs
- repo skill stubs
- workflow skill stubs
- company JARVIS entry skill stub

Templates:
- `templates/en/source-skill-stub.md`
- `templates/en/repo-skill-stub.md`
- `templates/en/workflow-skill-stub.md`
- `templates/en/company-jarvis-skill-stub.md`

Also create:
- `templates/en/skill-backlog.md`
- `templates/en/ownership-map.md`
- `templates/en/rollout-plan.md`

### Must confirm with humans
- which skills are truly needed for the pilot
- where repo-local truth should live
- which workflow should be explicit vs left for later
- ownership of each skill backlog item

### Stop if
- you are creating skills “just in case”
- you are centralizing repo-local truth that should live with repos
- the skill backlog has vague entries with no owner or outcome

### Read only if needed
- `references/en/source-skills.md`
- `references/en/repo-skills.md`
- `references/en/workflow-skills.md`
- `references/en/rollout-and-ownership.md`

---

## Phase 6 — CONFIRM

### Goal
Force a human confirmation pass before calling the result pilot-ready.

### Output
Run and complete:
- `templates/en/rollout-confirmation-checklist.md`

Review:
- build brief
- inventories
- generated skeleton
- skill stubs
- ownership map
- rollout plan

### Must confirm with humans
- business intent
- first loop
- included sources, repos, workflows
- source-of-truth locations
- owner assignments
- security / compliance-sensitive paths

### Stop if
- any truth-bearing field is still guessed
- placeholders are still ambiguous
- the pilot scope is still company-wide in disguise

### Read only if needed
- `references/en/company-adaptation.md`
- `references/en/instance-readiness.md`

---

## Phase 7 — PILOT-READY HANDOFF

### Goal
Declare the instance ready for a real pilot, not mature.

### Output
A pilot-ready result should include:
- confirmed build brief
- confirmed inventories for the pilot scope
- a usable root structure
- a usable company JARVIS entry skill
- the minimum source / repo / workflow skill stubs
- a skill backlog
- an ownership map
- a rollout plan
- a completed confirmation checklist

### Must say explicitly
- this is pilot-ready, not mature
- historical knowledge is still shallow unless it came from real work
- maturity must come from continued writeback

### Stop if
- you are tempted to describe the instance as complete or mature
- you are treating scaffolding as operational memory

### Read only if needed
- `references/en/instance-readiness.md`

---

## Phase 8 — GROW BY WRITEBACK

### Goal
Turn the pilot scaffold into a real JARVIS instance through actual use.

### Output
Only now should these files begin to accumulate real value:
- `known-issues.md`
- `decisions.md`
- `rejected-features.md`
- `test-coverage.md`
- `cross-cutting/module-interactions.md`
- `cross-cutting/version-changelog.md`

### Writeback rules
- promote repeated truths, not one-off chat residue
- record durable patterns, not chronological logs
- keep repo-local truth with the repo when appropriate
- update JARVIS after real START → WORK → END loops

### Must confirm with humans when needed
- whether a pattern is durable enough to promote
- whether a decision is real and lasting
- whether a rejection belongs in long-term memory

### Stop if
- you are writing speculative history
- you are copying raw source material instead of extracting patterns
- you are bloating overview files with operational noise

### Read only if needed
- `references/en/detailed-maintenance-contracts.md`
- `references/en/write-contracts.md`
- `references/en/anti-patterns.md`

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| “Let’s just generate the JARVIS repo first.” | A repo without a confirmed first loop is just a shell. |
| “We should inventory the whole company now.” | Pilot scope beats fake completeness. |
| “We can fill in the owners later.” | Ownership is a truth-bearing field, not decoration. |
| “We already know what the workflow probably is.” | Probable is not confirmed. Ask. |
| “We can generate known issues and decisions now and improve them later.” | Fake history poisons trust. Grow it from real work. |
| “We should create every possible skill while we’re here.” | Only bootstrap the skills needed for the first loop. |
| “These placeholders are obvious enough.” | If they can be mistaken for truth, they are not obvious enough. |

## Red Flags

- `SKILL.md` is not being treated as the main route
- references are driving the process instead of supporting it
- inventories are broader than the pilot scope
- owners, boundaries, or source-of-truth locations are guessed
- history files contain generated content with no real evidence
- repo-local truth is being centralized for convenience
- the output is described as mature before real writeback exists

## Verification

Before finishing, confirm:
- [ ] A first valuable loop is explicitly named and confirmed.
- [ ] Pilot-scope sources, repos, and workflows are inventoried.
- [ ] Intended artifacts were classified into scaffold / confirm / grow-later.
- [ ] The generated structure is company-specific enough to support a pilot.
- [ ] Only the minimum high-leverage skills were bootstrapped.
- [ ] A human confirmation pass was completed.
- [ ] The result is described as pilot-ready rather than mature.
- [ ] The path from pilot to real writeback-based growth is explicit.
