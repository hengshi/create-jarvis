# [Company / Product] JARVIS

[Company / Product] knowledge routing and synthesis layer for agents.

This repository helps agents:
- find the right module or source first,
- route into the right repo or system,
- understand recurring issues and decisions,
- and write back durable learnings after real work.

## What this repository is for

State in 2-4 sentences:
- what this JARVIS covers,
- who uses it,
- what the current rollout scope is,
- and what business loop it is helping unlock first.

## Use the right entrypoint

- business-domain question → `modules/<module>/overview.md`
- source-specific question → `sources/<source>/README.md`
- cross-domain question → `cross-cutting/*.md`
- reusable helper or manual → `tools/*`
- maintain the JARVIS itself → root `MAINTENANCE.md`
