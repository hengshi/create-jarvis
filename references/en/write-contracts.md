# Write Contracts

Generated JARVIS artifacts should be opinionated about what belongs where.

## Global contract

1. **Index, don’t dump.** Summaries, patterns, and routing clues are preferred over raw content duplication.
2. **One home per truth.** Route to the best source of truth instead of creating many half-truths.
3. **Separate method from company truth.** Reusable instructions and company-specific facts must be distinguishable.
4. **Prefer durable knowledge.** Capture knowledge that will help future agents and owners, not transient chatter.
5. **Write for continuation.** Another agent or owner should be able to continue without rediscovering basics.
